      <p>Thank you for using Hello PDF. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Hello PDF (the "App") operated by MahaRana Studios handles information when you use the App.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No personal data is collected directly by Hello PDF to provide app features.</li>
        <li>The App displays advertisements via Google AdMob. Ad networks may collect certain information for ad delivery and personalization.</li>
        <li>The App uses Firebase Crashlytics for crash reporting. Crashlytics may collect diagnostics and device data to help improve stability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>1. Information the App Does NOT Collect</h2>
      <p>Except for the activity described below from third-party SDKs, Hello PDF does not intentionally collect, store, or transmit personal information (such as your name, email address, location linked to you, contacts, documents, or other personal files) to MahaRana Studios.</p>

      <h2>2. Third-party Services</h2>
      <p>The App integrates third-party services that may collect information automatically. These services operate under their own privacy policies; we recommend reviewing them directly.</p>

      <h3>Google AdMob (Advertisements)</h3>
      <p>The App shows ads provided by Google AdMob. Ad networks may collect device identifiers, advertising identifiers, and usage data to deliver and personalize ads. You can review Google’s privacy information here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>. To opt out of personalized ads, you can change settings on your device or visit Google’s Ads Settings.</p>

      <h3>Firebase Crashlytics (Crash Reporting)</h3>
      <p>We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports, stack traces, and diagnostics that help us identify and fix issues. Crashlytics may collect technical data about your device (device model, OS version), app version, and crash logs. Firebase’s privacy policy: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.</p>

      <h2>3. Why this matters</h2>
      <p>While Hello PDF does not itself collect personal information for the app’s functioning, integrated SDKs (AdMob and Firebase) may process certain information. If you need to avoid any data collection by those providers, consider disabling ads or not using the app on that device; for AdMob and Google services you can also review and change ad personalization settings on your Google account or device.</p>

      <h2>4. Children</h2>
      <p>The App is intended for users of all ages and is not directed specifically to children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information to the App, please contact us at <a href="mailto:srkalwad1@gmail.com">srkalwad1@gmail.com</a> so we can take appropriate action.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>MahaRana Studios takes reasonable steps to protect information collected by third-party services. However, no transmission over the internet or storage system is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

      <h2>6. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>Third-party providers may transfer or process information in countries other than yours. These providers have their own safeguards; please review their privacy policies for details.</p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising, you can do so via your device settings or Google Ad Settings. For issues related to crash logs or diagnostics collected by Firebase, see Firebase’s support and privacy documentation for available controls.</p>

      <h2>8. Changes to this Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Effective date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

      <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our practices, contact MahaRana Studios at <a href="mailto:srkalwad1@gmail.com">srkalwad1@gmail.com</a>.</p>
